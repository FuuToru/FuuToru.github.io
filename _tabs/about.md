Welcome readers to my blog 😁

I am Dang Huu Tri, currently a student majoring in Data Science at the University of Industry Ho Chi Minh City.

In this blog, I will share everything I have learned, covering various topics related to my studies and work. Additionally, I am writing this blog in English to improve my language skills. If you notice any mistakes or inaccuracies, especially in technical terms, please provide feedback using the form below.

My future blog posts will focus on a variety of topics that I research. I plan to update the blog once a week, every Monday.

Thank you for visiting my blog 🥰 Enjoy it!
