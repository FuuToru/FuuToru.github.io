Welcome readers to my blog 😁

I am Đặng Hữu Trí, currently a student majoring in Data Science at the University of Industry Ho Chi Minh City.

This is where I will write about everything I have accumulated, covering various topics related to my studies and work. I will also share topics related to programming. The focus of my blog posts in the future will be on topics related to Image Processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP), which are the areas of research I have chosen to pursue.

Thank you for visiting my blog 🥰 Enjoy it!
