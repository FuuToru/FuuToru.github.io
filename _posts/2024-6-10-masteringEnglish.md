Restarting your English learning journey is an exciting endeavor, especially when you aim to use the language in your studies or at work. Since you already have some foundational knowledge, you don’t need to start from scratch. Instead, adopting a more consistent and sustainable approach will ensure long-term success. Here are three essential tips to help you improve your English to a native and natural level:

### 1. Immerse Yourself in the Language

Immersion is a timeless strategy for language learning. While it might sound cliché, it’s undeniably effective. This time, however, let’s explore different linguistic modes. Instead of just relying on written content, such as textbooks or articles from The Economist, venture into spoken language through vlogs, podcasts, and films. This exposure helps you internalize the rhythms, inflections, and pronunciations of English. By listening more and mimicking speakers you admire, your brain will adapt to the nuances of the language, making it easier to speak naturally and fluently.

### 2. Practice, Practice, Practice!

Practice is intertwined with immersion and is crucial for improving your speaking skills. Engage in dialogue lessons with native speakers on platforms like Italki or find a language partner for regular conversation exchanges. To avoid stagnation, set specific topics for your discussions. Debating on topics like whether TikTok should be banned can stimulate engaging conversations and expand your perspective. For solitary practice, try impromptu speeches on various topics without scripting them out. Recording yourself can add a bit of pressure, making the practice more effective.

### 3. Expand Your Corpus and Diversify Your Expressions

To elevate your oral English, proactively think of different ways to express the same idea. Learning idiomatic expressions and phrases can add richness to your vocabulary. For instance, instead of saying “improve to the next level,” you could say “bring something up a notch.” Familiarize yourself with idiomatic phrases like “piece of cake,” “hit the nail on the head,” or “under the weather.” Diversifying your expressions will make your speech more dynamic and natural.

By immersing yourself in the language, practicing regularly, and expanding your vocabulary, you can significantly improve your English fluency. Remember, the key is to keep your interest alive and build a routine. Set reminders to track your progress and make English a daily habit. With dedication and the right approach, you’ll be speaking English like a native in no time!
